Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# Note
1. 实现vue中的tag，在react中Link和NavLink输出的都是a标签，vue中有封装好的tag可以转化成想要的标签。  
useNavigate 返回一个函数用来实现编程式导航。
